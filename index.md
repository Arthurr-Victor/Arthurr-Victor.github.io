### A complete churn analysis
<br><br>
The problem of customer churn represents a central impasse for any telecommunications company. It is less costly to retain current customers than to acquire new ones. To address this issue, I conducted a descriptive and exploratory analysis on my dataset in order to identify which variables most influence customer churn. Next, I configured a well-known algorithm to perform the prediction of the target variable. After visualizing various metrics to define the threshold, I calculated the mathematical expectation, representing how much monetary equivalent my model would generate for the company.

### Customer Segmentation
<br><br>
Have you ever wondered how grocery stores determine which products to place where or how to create targeted marketing campaigns? The answer lies in customer segmentation. I applied clustering techniques to a dataset of grocery store customers to group them into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior. Through data analysis, I was able to describe the unique profile of each cluster, including their demographic information, preferred products, and shopping habits. This information can be used by grocery stores to optimize their inventory management, personalize their marketing efforts, and ultimately enhance the customer experience.
