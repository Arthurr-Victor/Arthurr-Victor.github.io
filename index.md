## A complete churn analysis
<br><br>
<em>The problem of customer churn represents a central impasse for any telecommunications company. It is less costly to retain current customers than to acquire new ones.  </em> <br><br>

I tackled this issue using Python as the primary tool. <br>
### Key Highlights

- **Data Exploration (EDA):** Conducted a thorough EDA, revealing vital insights:
   - Customers with annual or biennial contracts tend to be more loyal.
   - Monthly payment and manual payment methods are linked to higher churn rates.

- **Model Development:** Implemented a logistic regression algorithm after extensive data preprocessing and engineering.
   - The model successfully identified 72% of potential churn cases during validation.

- **Business Impact:** Calculated the expected value of $95 per customer by applying the model to real-world scenarios.
   - Provides actionable insights for informed decisions on customer retention strategies.

## Customer Segmentation
<br><br>
<em>Have you ever wondered how grocery stores determine which products to place where or how to create targeted marketing campaigns? The answer lies in customer segmentation!</em> <br><br>
I applied clustering techniques to a dataset of grocery store customers to group them into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior. Through data analysis, I was able to describe the unique profile of each cluster, including their demographic information, preferred products, and shopping habits. This information can be used by grocery stores to optimize their inventory management, personalize their marketing efforts, and ultimately enhance the customer experience.
