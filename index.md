## A complete churn analysis
<br><br>
<em>The problem of customer churn represents a central impasse for any telecommunications company. It is less costly to retain current customers than to acquire new ones.</em> <br><br>
In this project, I addressed the challenge using Python as main tool.

- I Conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis, uncovering critical insights:
   - Customers with annual or biennial contracts tend to exhibit higher loyalty.
   - Monthly payment and manual payment methods are associated with increased churn.


- Implemented a logistic regression algorithm after data preprocessing.
   - Achieved a validation accuracy of 72% in identifying potential churn cases.
   - 
- Calculated the expected value of $95 per customer by applying the model in real-world scenarios.
   - Empowers businesses to make informed decisions regarding customer retention strategies.

## Customer Segmentation
<br><br>
<em>Have you ever wondered how grocery stores determine which products to place where or how to create targeted marketing campaigns? The answer lies in customer segmentation!</em> <br><br>
I applied clustering techniques to a dataset of grocery store customers to group them into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior. Through data analysis, I was able to describe the unique profile of each cluster, including their demographic information, preferred products, and shopping habits. This information can be used by grocery stores to optimize their inventory management, personalize their marketing efforts, and ultimately enhance the customer experience.
